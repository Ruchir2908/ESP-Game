Given plenty of time I can add a password field which can help in handling multiple users with same username.

The individual item in the recycler view can be modified to dislplay small images of the primary questions.

There can be a personalized dashboard showing my current unsolved tasks, ongoing task(my opponent has yet not solved the task) and completed tasks - Taking inspiration from SquadRun App :)

The UI can be improved with the help of various libraries.

The tasks can be used to show more than 2 options and these options varied for each image.
